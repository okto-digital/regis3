## Philosophy: Clean Code

1. **Make it work, make it right, make it fast** (in that order)
2. **Small is beautiful** - small functions, small files
3. **Express intent** - code should read like prose
4. **One thing** - functions do one thing
5. **DRY** - every piece of knowledge has one authoritative representation
